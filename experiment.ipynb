It is not a one-size-fits-all concept, as individuals have different experiences, perspectives, and needs. Religious guidelines and support systems can provide structure and guidance in navigating life's challenges, but ultimately, it is up to us to determine our own path. Life can be both beautiful and challenging, and it is important to exercise caution and empathy when interacting with others, as we may not fully understand their experiences. In times of danger or emergency, taking action to save lives is crucial. There are also ongoing advancements in medical research and patient-driven drug development that aim to improve and prolong lives.
